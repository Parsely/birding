birding: public API twitter search stream
-----------------------------------------

Work in progress. Developing for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. Create a
virtualenv, then::

    python setup.py develop

Original motivation: a `streamparse <https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse>`_
and `pykafka <https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka>`_ project which is both
useful as a stream processing application and as an example project.
